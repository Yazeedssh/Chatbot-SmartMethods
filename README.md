## Creating a chatbot using IBM Watson Assistant

### *First 

We have to go to this websit https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-assistant > Create a new account in ibm watson > Click on " Get started free "  to start free trial

### *Second

Click on " Create a new assistant " and write a name and description if you want > Click on " Create Assistant " 

### *Third 

Now we have the assistant and we must give it some skills > Click on " Skills " > Add dialoge skill

### *Fourth 

From skills click on " intent " > Click on " Create intant " by creating an intent we train our assistant to understand the variety of ways users express a goal

To make an intant we have to give it a name and add discription and many ways to think about it and to give it the ability to deal with different usres

### *Fifth

Click on " Contant catalog " and add the skills you want

### *Sixth

Go to " Entity " name a category and give it a description and some details and many ways to think about it to help the assisant 

### *Seventh

From " Dialog " > Click on " Add node "  and give it a proper name > Add the replay down and choose the type of the replay (Text,Photo,etc..)

We also have to add " Child node " because intracting with different users will make it more diffecult and we must give it more details

### Now we can try our assistant

1- Clicking on " try it " in the top of the website and try to improve its performence 

Or 

2- Choosing our assistant and click on " merge " to try it
